}
\arguments{
\item{drug_exposure}{A dataframs-like object correspondint to the OMOP CDM `drug_exposure` table}

\item{condition_occurrence}{A dataframs-like object correspondint to the OMOP CDM `condition_occurrence` table}

\item{visit_occurrence}{A dataframs-like object correspondint to the OMOP CDM `visit_occurrence` table}

\item{event}{The event of interest}

\item{minimum_duration}{The minimum duration that a patient needs to be under observation to be included in the

\description{
Make events table for [prepareBRDataFromEvents] from occurrence tables (rather than era tables).
